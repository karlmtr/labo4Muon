This folder contains a python application which allows one to simulate
the attenuation of a given muon through layers of different materials.

## How to run the program ?
Install locally the program as follows (place yourself in the git main folder):
```sh
python3 -m pip install -e pymuon
```
Then move into the *pymuon/* folder and install the dependencies:
```sh
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Create your code into the *examples/* folder.
To run your code in this folder (or any others), place yourself in the
main folder (*pymuon*) and run:

```sh
python3 examples/my_code.py
```
